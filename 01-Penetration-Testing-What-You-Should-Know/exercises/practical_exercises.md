# Practical Exercises: Penetration Testing Fundamentals

These exercises will help you develop the mindset and approach needed for the OSCP exam. Complete them to build a solid foundation in penetration testing methodology.

## Exercise 1: Develop Your Penetration Testing Methodology

**Objective:** Create a personalized, detailed penetration testing methodology that you can follow during the OSCP exam.

**Tasks:**
1. Research at least three established penetration testing methodologies (PTES, OSSTMM, OWASP Testing Guide)
2. Create a hybrid methodology that works for your approach
3. Document each phase with:
   - Specific objectives
   - Tools you'll use
   - Expected outputs
   - Time allocation
4. Create a one-page "cheat sheet" version you can quickly reference during the exam

**Deliverable:** A detailed document and a one-page summary of your methodology

## Exercise 2: Reconnaissance Challenge

**Objective:** Practice passive information gathering techniques on a legitimate target.

**Tasks:**
1. Select a company that has a bug bounty program (to ensure legal compliance)
2. Using ONLY passive techniques (no direct scanning), gather:
   - Domain information
   - IP ranges
   - Employee information
   - Technologies used
   - Potential security issues
3. Document your findings and methodology
4. Reflect on how this information could be useful in a penetration test

**Deliverable:** A reconnaissance report with your findings and methodology

## Exercise 3: Vulnerability Research Practice

**Objective:** Develop skills in researching and understanding vulnerabilities.

**Tasks:**
1. Select three recent CVEs (within the last year) related to:
   - A web application
   - A Windows service
   - A Linux service
2. For each vulnerability, document:
   - The affected systems/versions
   - The technical details of the vulnerability
   - Available exploits
   - Mitigation strategies
3. Create a simple scoring system to prioritize these vulnerabilities in a theoretical penetration test

**Deliverable:** A vulnerability analysis report

## Exercise 4: OSCP Exam Time Management Simulation

**Objective:** Practice time management for the OSCP exam environment.

**Tasks:**
1. Create a simulated OSCP exam environment with:
   - 5 theoretical machines of varying difficulty
   - Point values for each machine (like the actual exam)
   - A 23h45m time limit
2. Develop a detailed plan for:
   - Initial reconnaissance approach
   - Order of machine targeting
   - Time allocation per machine
   - Break schedules
   - Contingency plans for when you get stuck
3. Include specific triggers for when to move on from a machine

**Deliverable:** A detailed exam strategy document

## Exercise 5: Documentation Practice

**Objective:** Improve your documentation skills, which are critical for the OSCP exam.

**Tasks:**
1. Select a simple CTF challenge or vulnerable VM
2. Complete the challenge while documenting EVERY step:
   - Commands run (successful and unsuccessful)
   - Screenshots of key findings
   - Your thought process
   - Tools used
3. Create a professional penetration testing report based on your findings
4. Have a peer review your documentation for clarity and completeness

**Deliverable:** A comprehensive penetration testing report

## Exercise 6: Legal and Ethical Considerations

**Objective:** Understand the legal framework surrounding penetration testing.

**Tasks:**
1. Research the legal requirements for penetration testing in your jurisdiction
2. Create a template for:
   - Penetration testing authorization form
   - Scope of work document
   - Rules of engagement
3. List potential legal issues that could arise during testing and how to avoid them
4. Document the proper disclosure process for any vulnerabilities you might find

**Deliverable:** A legal considerations document and templates

## Submission Guidelines

For each exercise:
1. Document your process thoroughly
2. Include screenshots where appropriate
3. Reflect on what you learned and how it applies to the OSCP exam
4. Identify areas where you need more practice

Remember, the OSCP exam tests not just your technical skills but also your methodology, persistence, and documentation abilities. These exercises will help you develop all these aspects.
