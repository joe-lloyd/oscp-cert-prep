# Penetration Testing: What You Should Know

[← Back to Main Menu](../readme.md) | [Next Module: Getting Comfortable with Kali Linux →](../02-Getting-Comfortable-with-Kali-Linux/)

## Introduction
Penetration testing (pentesting) is a simulated cyber attack against computer systems to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. This is a critical skill for the OSCP certification and forms the foundation of your journey as a security professional.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Penetration Testing Methodology
The OSCP exam follows a structured approach to penetration testing. Understanding these methodologies is crucial:

- **Pre-engagement**: Scope definition, rules of engagement
- **Information Gathering**: Passive and active reconnaissance
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifying potential security weaknesses
- **Exploitation**: Leveraging vulnerabilities to gain access
- **Post-Exploitation**: Privilege escalation, maintaining access
- **Documentation**: Reporting findings and recommendations

### 2. Types of Penetration Tests

- **Black Box**: Tester has no prior knowledge of the target system
- **White Box**: Tester has complete knowledge of the target system
- **Grey Box**: Tester has partial knowledge of the target system

### 3. Legal and Ethical Considerations

- **Authorization**: Always obtain proper written permission
- **Scope**: Stay within defined boundaries
- **Data Handling**: Protect sensitive information discovered during testing
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Follow proper channels for reporting vulnerabilities

## OSCP-Specific Approach

The OSCP exam emphasizes a "Try Harder" mentality and tests your ability to:

1. **Think methodically**: Follow a structured approach to penetration testing
2. **Adapt to challenges**: Overcome obstacles through persistence and creativity
3. **Document thoroughly**: Create comprehensive reports of your findings
4. **Manage time effectively**: Complete multiple objectives within the exam timeframe

## Tools Overview

While specific tools will be covered in later lessons, here are some essential categories:

- **Reconnaissance tools**: Nmap, Recon-ng, theHarvester
- **Vulnerability scanners**: OpenVAS, Nessus
- **Exploitation frameworks**: Metasploit (limited use in OSCP), manual exploitation
- **Web application tools**: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP
- **Password attacks**: Hydra, John the Ripper, Hashcat

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Define Your Methodology
Create a personal penetration testing methodology checklist that you can follow during the OSCP exam. Include specific steps and tools for each phase.

### Exercise 2: Legal Considerations
Research and document the legal requirements for conducting penetration tests in your jurisdiction. What permissions would you need before starting a test?

### Exercise 3: Reconnaissance Practice
Select a public website (that you have permission to test) and conduct passive reconnaissance only. Document what information you can gather without directly interacting with the target.

### Exercise 4: OSCP Exam Strategy
Create a time management plan for the OSCP exam. How will you allocate your 23 hours and 45 minutes across multiple targets? What will you do if you get stuck?

## Remember
The OSCP is not just about technical skills but also about methodology, persistence, and documentation. The exam tests your ability to approach problems systematically and adapt when your initial approach doesn't work.

**"Try Harder"** - The unofficial OSCP motto that emphasizes persistence and creative problem-solving.
