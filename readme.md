# OSCP Certification

This project outlines the requirements and resources needed to prepare for the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification. Each folder is a lesson with examples of the tools and techniques used in the OSCP exam, along with practical exercises and environments for hands-on learning.

## Project Structure

Each lesson folder contains:
- **README.md**: Core concepts and theory
- **examples/**: Practical examples and code snippets
- **exercises/**: Hands-on tasks to reinforce learning
- **resources/**: Additional tools, scripts, and Docker environments (where applicable)

# What are the OSCP exam requirements?

OffSec’s Penetration Testing with Kali Linux (PWK/PEN-200) course packages include one or more exam attempts. After completing the course, or when the student feels ready, they can sit for the OSCP certification.

Unlike some professional certifications, there are no educational or work experience prerequisites for taking the OSCP exam.

OffSec suggests that candidates should have a solid understanding of TCP/IP networking, reasonable Windows and Linux administration experience, and be familiar with basic Bash or Python scripting. Candidates take the exam as the concluding portion of the OffSec training course.

Students or professionals considering an OSCP certification should be problem-solvers and analytical thinkers. OffSec has designed the preparation course and exam to test candidates’ ability to apply critical thinking to problem-solving.
